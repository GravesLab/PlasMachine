		<p class="normal"><img src="connor.jpg" width=150 height=120><br><a href="mailto:connorgalleher@berkeley.edu">Connor Galleher</a> is a third year undergraduate student in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at University of California, Berkeley. His research in the Graves lab has focused on practical applications of low temperature ambient gas plasmas. In the past Connor has worked on preventing fruit spoilage with plasma technology. He has also worked with a medical doctor from University of California, San Francisco to develop a disinfection protocol for a material known as LifeWrap, which is used in the developing world to prevent maternal death during childbirth. In addition to the Graves lab, Connor has also performed research at The Scripps Research Institute in San Diego studying the signaling pathways in cells and at the Joint Bio Energy Institute, developing an efficient method to produce high quality biofuels. Connor is a Regents and Chancellor Scholar who anticipates graduating in May 2014.</p>

		<p class="normal"><img src="matt.jpg" width=100 height=120><br><a href="mailto:mattpavlovich@berkeley.edu">Matt Pavlovich</a> is a fourth-year graduate student in Chemical Engineering at UC Berkeley. His research in the Graves lab has focused on the basic science and application of ambient-gas plasma disinfection, with a particular interest in characterizing gas- and aqueous-phase chemistry and correlating it to plasma antimicrobial effect. Matt also studies the interaction between plasma species and high-energy photons. He received the Department of Homeland Security's STEM fellowship and anticipates graduating in 2014.</p>

		<p class="normal"><img src="http://graves-lab.cchem.berkeley.edu/image/dave.jpg" width=110 height=120><br>The laboratory science behind our technology was performed in the lab of Professor <a href="http://graves-lab.cchem.berkeley.edu/">David B. Graves</a>. Professor Graves' research focuses on the physics, chemistry, and technological applications of low-temperature plasma science. Currently, the group focuses on two major areas of research: plasma processing of films and surfaces as it relates to electronics fabrication, and biomedical applications of plasma to bacteria, biomolecules, and mammalian cells.</p>

		<p class="normal">Other team members and collaborators include Prof. Douglas S. Clark (UC Berkeley), Pritha Hait and Leo Kao (UC Berkeley), and Prof. Zdenko Machala (on leave from Comenius University, Slovakia).</p>
