		<p class="header">Our technology</p>

		<div class="box">

		<p class="normal">Our previous research has focused primarily on developing plasma photochemical devices and techniques within a lab setting. We have previously measured the chemistry and antimicrobial effects both on <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ppap.201200073/full">solid surfaces</a> and in  <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0022-3727/46/14/145202">liquid volumes</a> using a similar device specially fabricated in a machine shop and running off an expensive, bulky power supply that requires AC line input.</p>

		<p class="normal">We aim to produce a new version of the device that can be made cheaply and is entirely "self-contained". To accomplish this, we will need to re-design the device and its power supply. Then, we will need to measure its chemical and antimicrobial effects to make sure the technology is similarly effective in the "field" as in the lab.In addition, our research so far has focused on relatively small liquid volumes. To be a useful platform for drinking-water disinfection, we will need to scale up our existing technology to treat larger volumes.</p>

		</div>

		<p class="header">Design goals</p>

		<div class="box">

		<p class="normal">The first step will be to design and fabricate a prototype device and power supply. The power supply will operate on a source of power that is both portable and relatively renewable, ideally solar power. To provide expertise in solar power, we will collaborate with <a href="http://wecaresolar.org/">WE CARE Solar</a> to leverage their existing "Solar Suitcase" technology for use with our system. Next, we will develop prototype designs for the combined plasma/UV device and fabricate them. Our goal is to develop each prototype device for less than $100 with the understanding that production costs are likely to drop if our device enters mass production. We anticipate completing the power supply and device re-design by the end of August 2013.</p>

		<p class="normal">Once the first goal is accomplished, we will conduct water disinfection experiments using non-pathogenic <i>E. coli</i> as a model organism. Both the aqueous-phase chemistry and the antimicrobial effect will be measured, and we will compare these results to our lab-scale system. Because we have already developed these assays, we expect this to be the more straightforward part of the commitment, and we anticipate completing these experiments by the end of December 2013.</p>

		</div>

		<p class="header">Characterization</p>

		<div class="box">

		<p class="normal">According to the United States EPA, the acceptable <a href="http://water.epa.gov/drink/contaminants/index.cfm">standard</a> for coliform bacteria in drinking water is 0/100 ml, and less than 5% of samples must be positive for total coliforms. Therefore, we will design the device such that it is capable of treating 100 ml of water at a time. Then, we will identify an operational setting that is capable of completely disinfecting 100 ml of water and repeat the experiment 20 times, expecting that no more than one trial will leave residual <i>E. coli</i>. We will report the percentage of times that disinfection with our device leaves residual bacteria; the average concentration in colony-forming units/100 ml; and the log reduction, a ratio of bacteria prior to treatment to bacteria that survived treatment.</p>
